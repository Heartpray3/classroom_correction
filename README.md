# GitHub Classroom Fetcher ðŸŽ“

This tool is designed to automate the process of pulling repositories from assignments given in a GitHub classroom 
based on their names. Not just that, it also checks if the repositories have commits made before a specified deadline. 
If they do, the script checks out to a new branch named `correction` from that commit. The utility can also push to the 
appropriate repositories, making the entire correction process smoother.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Pull Repositories**: Fetch all repositories from an assignment in a GitHub Classroom using their names.
  
- **Commit Check**: Determine if a repository has commits made before a certain deadline.
  
- **Auto Checkout**: If a valid commit is found, checkout to a new branch called `correction` from that commit.
  
- **Push Capability**: Can push the changes back to the appropriate repositories.
